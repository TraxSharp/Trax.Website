            Each junction&apos;s output is stored in Memory by type. The next
            junction declares what it needs as its input, and Trax wires them
            together. You never pass values between steps by hand.

          <p>
            The same structure is what the rest of Trax is built on. Because
            every step is declared before the train runs, the host checks the
            whole chain at startup, the run record names the exact junction
            that failed, and the train can be published as a typed API without
            a controller.
